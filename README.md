# Sentiment-Analysis-based-on-CovidSenti-twitter-data
The problem addressed in this project is automatically classifying tweets into three sentiment categories — positive, neutral, and negative — using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and deep learning.

DATA SOURCE

Dataset Name: COVIDSenti
Dataset Size: 90,000 labelled tweets
Classes: Positive (6,280), Negative (16,335), Neutral (67,835)
The dataset, as mentioned above, is imbalanced and contains significant noise. To address these issues and improve quality, we performed extensive preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to clean and prepare the data for modelling.
